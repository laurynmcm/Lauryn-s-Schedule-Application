This application contains a working clock and editable table inw hich you can schedule you events throughout the work day.
Each slot will turn orange when it is that specific time and grey when that time has passed. All future time slots appear green.
There is a button that you can use to clear all your events and the save buttons will save for that specific slot so that
your events will appear when the page is refreshed.
